# Simulationen
Simulations as examples

[Monte-Carlo-Simulations](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte-Carlo-Simulation) are a stochastic method. The R scripts in this git are only examples to demonstrate the techniques.

# Survival

Examples to simulate survivals and draw corresponding Kaplan-Meier charts. 

## Phase3Study

A vaccine phase 3 study is a field test to prove the effectivness of a vaccine. The simulation *Phase3Studie* is a trival simulation to demonstrate the limitations of deducing the effectivness of a vaccine in a phase 3.

A placebo group and different treatmentgroups are simulated in this script.

## Pi
